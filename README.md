# Gesture Based UI Development

## Week 1
### Objective
The objective of this lab is to gain hands-on experience with building machine learning models using scikit-learn, also
known as sklearn. We will be building Linear Regression Models of some form throughout, and we will be assessing
them too.
Assessment and interpreting results is just as, if not more, important than building the models. Having an under-standing how each different type of model works will allow us to better interpret the results, evaluate the model and
maybe improve the model in the future.
